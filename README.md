## Inspiration
We wanted to make saving the planet and promoting sustainability fun again, but with the help of Habitat Companions or Habicos!

## What it does
Habico turns recycling, energy saving, and exercising into XP for your Habico! 

## How we built it
We used React Native for cross-platform development, custom animated components for pet and toast animations, and tracks sustainable habits, moods, and achievements.  

## Challenges we ran into
Sequencing multiple animations smoothly, keeping the pet and toast centered, and updating state dynamically without causing glitches.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
A fully interactive Tamagotchi-style pet, visually satisfying achievement animations, and a lightweight app built entirely in React Native.  

## What we learned
How to coordinate animations with state management, create responsive UX in React Native, and balance gamification with usability.  

## What's next for Habico
Add more pet types and customization into the shop, logging actions through pictures and step counters through external health apps, add more moods and make the sprites reflect the moods, allows the Habico to get dirty and needs cleaning by doing more complex tasks that promote sustainability.
